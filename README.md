KindleMind-Model: Fine-Tuned LightGCN for Personalized Recommendations 🤖


KindleMind-Model is a machine learning system built on top of the LightGCN architecture, fine-tuned using real-world datasets to power personalized content and peer recommendations. It serves as the engine behind the KindleMind ecosystem, learning from user interactions, resource data, and user profiles to deliver meaningful recommendations at scale.


Model Features ⚙️


Resource Recommendations: Suggests personalized learning or content resources based on user behavior and preferences.


Similar User Discovery: Finds users with similar patterns and interests using graph-based embedding techniques.


Trained on Diverse Data: Uses a multi-source approach:


User–Resource Interactions


Resource Metadata (type, category, stage)


User Profiles (preferences, background info)


Graph-Based Learning: LightGCN is used for its effectiveness in learning user-item relationships without heavy parameter overhead.
